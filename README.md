Changed the styling for the overall layout.

Added a neumorphism kinda styled layout.

The Start Game button uses a linear-gradient with some box-shadows.

The game itself looks kinda like it did from the beginning. Updated the win and lose colors. Also added the neumorphism-style to the visible letters.
